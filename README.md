## __Description__
To create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

### __Installation__
Installation:  You will need to have Node installed and then run ```npm install``` to be able to run.  To run the program locally, you can either install ![Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) or just run ```node server.js```.  After this step, open your browser and navigate to ```localhost:8080```.  This should display the app.
